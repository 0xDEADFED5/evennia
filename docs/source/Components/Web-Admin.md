# The Web Admin

The Evennia _Web admin_ is a customized [Django admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/contrib/admin/)
and is used for manipulating the game database using a graphical interface.

All actions done in the admin can also be done in-game by use of Admin- or
Builder-commands. The only exception is the assigning of `staff` flags for
allowing users access to the admin itself.
