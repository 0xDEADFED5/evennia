"""
The Django Rest Framework provides a way of generating urls for different
views that implement standard CRUD operations in a quick way, using 'routers'
and 'viewsets'. A viewset implements standard CRUD actions and any custom actions
that you want, and then a router will automatically generate URLs based on the
actions that it detects for a viewset. For example, below we create a DefaultRouter.
We then register ObjectDBViewSet, a viewset for CRUD operations for ObjectDB
instances, to the 'objects' base endpoint. That will generate a number of URLs
like the following:
list objects:    action: GET, url: /objects/, view name: object-list
create object:   action: POST, url: /objects/, view name: object-list
retrieve object: action: GET, url: /objects/<:pk>, view name: object-detail
update object:   action: POST, url: /objects/<:pk>, view name: object-detail
delete object:   action: DELETE, url: /objects/<:pk>, view name: object-detail
set attribute:   action: POST, url: /objects/<:pk>/set-attribute, view name: object-set-attribute
